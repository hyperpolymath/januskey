== Welcome to JanusKey

JanusKey is a provably reversible file operations utility that achieves complete reversibility through architectural design rather than logging or backups. Unlike traditional backup systems that restore from external state, JanusKey operations carry sufficient information for perfect inversion—making data loss architecturally impossible.

=== Core Philosophy

JanusKey implements *Maximal Principle Reduction (MPR)*, a security methodology where vulnerability elimination occurs by construction rather than verification. This represents a fundamental shift from:

=== Key Guarantees

1. **100% Reversibility**: Every operation can be undone, always
2. **Instant Rollback**: Undo changes in milliseconds, not hours
3. **Data Loss Impossible**: Not "unlikely"—architecturally impossible
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change tracked automatically
5. **Transaction Support**: Group operations, commit/rollback together
6. **Content-Addressed Storage**: SHA256 hashing with deduplication

=== The Janus Symbol

The name "JanusKey" derives from Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, endings, doorways, and transitions. Janus is typically depicted with two faces—one looking to the past, one to the future. This perfectly captures the essence of JanusKey:

* **Forward Operations**: Execute changes moving from present state to future state
* **Reverse Operations**: Perfect restoration from any point back to the past

The "Key" represents the cryptographic foundation (SHA256 content addressing) that ensures integrity and enables the formal guarantees of the system.

=== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Build from source
cd src/januskey
cargo build --release

# Initialize in a directory
jk init

# Delete files (reversible)
jk delete *.log

# Instantly undo
jk undo

# Group operations
jk begin "cleanup"
jk delete temp*.txt
jk move old/ archive/
jk preview    # Review changes
jk commit     # Or: jk rollback
