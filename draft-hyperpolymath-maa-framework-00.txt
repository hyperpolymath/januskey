                                   Mutually Assured Accountability (MAA) Framework
                                                            Abstract

The widespread reliance on unverifiable, best-effort transactional
integrity and data deletion mechanisms in decentralized systems
constitutes a systemic trust deficit. This deficit leads to chronic
compliance failures (e.g., GDPR Article 17) and unrecoverable state
corruption in Edge and IoT deployments. This document introduces the
Mutually Assured Accountability (MAA) Framework, a novel ethical
and engineering paradigm. MAA operationalises the **Maximal
Principle Reduction (MPR)** axiom by defining a set of formally
verifiable, dual primitives (RMR and RMO) that structurally enforce
a balance between auditability and user autonomy. The MAA Framework
proposes achieving system dependability through mathematically
certain state reversibility and data obliteration, thereby replacing
operational logging reliance with structural, formal assurance.

                                   1. Introduction

The principles governing data management in high-assurance,
decentralized systems remain fundamentally reliant on operational
accountability methods (logging, monitoring, eventual consistency).
These methods fail to provide **epistemological certainty**—the
mathematical guarantee that a system state is correct, or that a
deleted record no longer exists. This gap leads to structural trust
deficits.

The MAA Framework addresses this by establishing two symmetrical,
formally verifiable primitives derived from the MPR axiom. These
primitives are structurally guaranteed by the **Oblíbený** language's
constraint-driven compilation model:

* **RMR (Reversible Transaction):** A primitive for state transitions
  that guarantees instant, mathematically certain rollback to a
  prior safe state via Algorithmic Reversibility. This maximizes
  system auditability and dependability.

* **RMO (Obliterative Wipe):** A primitive for data erasure that
  achieves Formal Obliteration, proving the non-existence of
  specified data traces, thereby providing verifiable individual
  autonomy.

The MAA dynamic dictates that the deployment of RMR (Accountability)
must be coupled with RMO (Control), stabilizing the system through
a mutually enforced set of formal constraints.

                                   2. Terminology

The key terms defined within this document are:

* **MAA (Mutually Assured Accountability):** The ethical and
  engineering paradigm that structurally balances adversarial
  system requirements using formal verification.

* **MPR (Maximal Principle Reduction):** The core axiom used to
  constrain system complexity to a minimal, verifiable subset.

* **Oblíbený:** The specialized language and compiler toolchain that
  enforces the MPR axiom via a Turing-Incomplete Deployment Subset.

* **RMR (Reversible Transaction):** A data primitive, implemented
  via the **Oblíbený** toolchain (targeting Rust/WASM), that guarantees
  the existence of a mathematically sound inverse function for every
  state change.

* **RMO (Obliterative Wipe):** A data primitive that guarantees,
  via formal proof, the non-existence (unrecoverability) of specific
  data after invocation, satisfying the Right to Erasure.

                                3. MAA and Formal Integrity
  
Current distributed transaction models (e.g., Two-Phase Commit, Saga)
are complex and can enter blocking or inconsistent states. RMR
proposes replacement with a simple, formally verified mechanism
where the guarantee of integrity is based on the proven symmetry of
the underlying function: $F^{-1}(\text{F}(\text{State})) = \text{State}$. The
formal proof scripts for RMR demonstrate that the primitive is
structurally incapable of leaving the state corrupted.

                                   4. MAA and User Autonomy

RMO addresses the chronic failure of data persistence to honour user
deletion requests. The primitive ensures that the integrity of the
data record is broken and its digital reminiscence is eliminated. This
capability is crucial for compliance with privacy frameworks,
providing a verifiable technical mechanism for the individual's
right to control their digital history.

                                   5. Security Considerations

The MAA framework shifts the security focus from patch management
to structural design. Security is assured by forcing the smallest
possible Trusted Computing Base (TCB) at the protocol/primitive
layer. The integrity of the MAA framework itself relies on the rigor
of the formal verification proofs (e.g., using Isabelle/HOL and Z3)
which must be auditable and maintained openly (e.g., as FOSS).

                                   6. IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA considerations.

                                   7. Acknowledgements

The principles of the MAA framework are grounded in the work on
Algorithmic Reversibility (Bennett) and the thermodynamic limits of
information erasure (Landauer). The axiomatic foundation was further
sharpened by the philosophical challenge of resolving
epistemological dilemmas (Wittgenstein and Russell) and by the
critical necessity to clearly articulate verifiable security concepts
in response to challenges raised by Joshua Jewell.
